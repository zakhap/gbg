## Glass Bead Game Rules

The practice uses symbolic notation to connect concepts:

**Structural Connections:**
- `═══` Logical necessity
- `───` Logical dependency  
- `>>>` Temporal sequence
- `^^^` Emergence
- `vvv` Reduction

**Aesthetic Connections:**
- `~~~` Metaphorical resonance
- `◊◊◊` Ironic reflection
- `∞∞∞` Recursive relationship
- `???` Productive tension
- `!!!` Revelatory leap

**Synthesis Points:**
- `※` Minor synthesis
- `◊` Major synthesis
- `★` Transcendent synthesis
